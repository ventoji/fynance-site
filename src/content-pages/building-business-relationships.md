Business networking is an effective low-cost marketing method for developing sales opportunities and contacts, based on referrals and introductions – either face-to-face at meetings and gatherings, or by other contact methods such as phone, email, and increasingly social and business networking websites.

An essential part of business success is having a strong network. In fact,*[ a Harvard study found that 85%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2012/04/20/the-secret-to-successful-networking-is-a-four-letter-word/#3ad56a52e3a3)*  of professional success comes from people skills. Though it certainly must be easier to build a network if you’re inherently part of a world of business and money, all you really need to build a good network is to be willing to meet new people and step out of your comfort zone.

Networking also doesn’t have to be as soul-stealing as it’s reputation suggests. Networks are really just a collection of friends, teammates and acquaintances. And in good networks, relationships are balanced. People help each other equally and genuinely care about the well-being and success of each other.
