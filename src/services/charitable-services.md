## Giving back isn’t about affluence. It’s about influence.

Private foundations, endowments and nonprofit organizations that are focused on giving back face unique financial challenges. Fynance.com provides comprehensive, targeted consulting services designed specifically to enhance the management of foundation and endowment assets and support the needs of planned giving services. The experience of our professionals can augment the strengths of your existing staff and help your organization work toward its mission.

## Private foundations

If your family has a private foundation (or seeks to establish one), you can leverage the experience and abilities of our team at the Charitable Services Group to handle day-to-day administration, freeing you to focus on your foundation’s purpose. We can work as your foundation’s virtual office and staff or as an extension of your existing staff, providing support across a broad spectrum of key functions, including:

    * Establishment of the foundation, including collaborating with tax and legal advisors on organizational formation and completion and filing of required documentation
    * Setting objectives for the foundation and planning strategies to work toward philanthropic goals while potentially avoiding legal and personal issues
    * Crafting administrative procedures such as guidelines for foundation funds, communications, procedures and forms for grant applicants
    * Financial reporting for each entity and processing of grants and scholarships with a focus on reducing the administrative burden on the family
    * Regulatory support to ensure that the foundation remains compliant with tax laws and other legal reporting requirements, including the preparation of private foundation tax returns
